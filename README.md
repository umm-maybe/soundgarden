Generative music using genetic algorithms

## Goals
To grow a garden of music generators.

Currently there is one generator type, a Markov-based sample playback sequencer.

## Requirements
The generator uses Python 3 and CSound; those must be installed first.

## To-Do
All of the genetic algorithm logic.
